# Load-Balancing-in-Servers

Suppose multiple clients simultaneously make a request for a file(same or different) from a server.

Now if the number of clients are below the threshold value, then one server can easily fulfill all their requests based on some priority(burst time , throughput etc.)

But if clients count increases we have to make copies of the server, 

but problem is how to decide which server to send the request and how much requests count  it can handle at a time.
