# Load-Balancing-in-Servers

Suppose multiple clients simultaneously make a request for a file(same or different) from a server, then server has to prioritize their request using process scheduling algorithm.


 Now if the number of clients are below the threshold value, then one server can easily fulfill all their requests based on some priority(burst time , throughput etc
 
 
But if clients count increases we have to make copies of the server, store all of their request in a queue and based on a process scheduling algorithm , print a Gant Chart which shows the sequence in which process will be executed.



Techniques to be used :


Multithreading (multiple clients can make request at the same time).

CPU Scheduling (There will be many requests/processes so we have prioritize them using scheduling algorithm)

MySql Database( to store the content in a organized and easily retrievable manner)
